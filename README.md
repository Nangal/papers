papers
======
This repository contains pointers to interesting papers on several subjects available on the web. To get started, you'll need [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com) installed on your system. This might be available using your package manager, or otherwise by running `cabal install git-annex` assuming you have `cabal` installed.

Once `git-annex` is available, clone the repository and `cd` into it. Then run `git annex init`. Now call `git annex get` to start downloading *all* papers, or `git annex path/to/file.pdf` to only retrieve a single paper.
